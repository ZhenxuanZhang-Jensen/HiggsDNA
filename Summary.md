# compare following distribution in boosted region among SL signal, FH signal and data SB
## 1. MET(both pf & puppi)
## 2. $ \triangle \phi (AK8 jet, MET)$
## 3. Apart from the signal AL8 jets, we will have many AK4 jets, so doing those AK4 jet get this: $min \triangle \phi (AK4 jets, MET)$
## 4. If more than 1 ak8 jet exists then compute min $\triangle \phi$ similar to 3rd point $min \triangle \phi (AK8, MET)$
# Todo list:
- [ ] check if we already save MET info
- [ ] ~~save $\triangle \phi$(AK8 jet, MET) in ntuples~~ just create the $\triangle \phi$(AK8 jet, MET) in further analysis like in SWAN
